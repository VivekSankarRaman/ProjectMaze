Hello!

You have been tasked with completing a programming assignment as part of our interview process.

If you look in the 'Assignment Assets' folder, you will find the technical specification (ProgrammingTest.pdf) which details what to deliver.

You will also find the following:

- UI Designs (Visual representation of how the product owner would like the program to look)
- Assets (Images, Audios & Icons)
- JSON file (List of questions for the program to use)

We use Angular for our front end applications so have created you a basic project to use.

If you are new to Angular, refer to the following link on how to get setup: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

To run the project locally, run the following commands:

- `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- `npm install`
- `ng serve`

Then go to 'http://localhost:4200/' in your web browser.

Once ready for submission, please upload to your own GitHub repository and either send us the link or invite the account https://github.com/IDLDevs to view.

If you have any questions, please email: jacob.withers@ascentis.co.uk.

Thanks,
Jake (Jacob Withers)
